Doing so will ask you for a timer, and may ask you to choose a button to click if there are multiples. If you proceed so, you will have a timer that you can click for activating and de-activating the timer. You can remove it completely by starting assignation of a new timer and canceling it. This can be used to trigger Question Qubes over time, or improving sand industry regularly after a molping down, reducing repetitive spaming activities in just a few clicks.\r\n* Improving Beach Autoclick by adding an \"ninja ritual\" setting, that will ninja every NP, gathering goats.\r\n* NEW : Rift Autoclick - 2 settings. \"Gather Flux Cristals\" will use rifts after they close until you have no more Time Lord rift available, and waiting for the NPB to have been ninja'd. \"ONG\" will use rifts to create a maximum of ONGs. It will always wait for the game to have sand (for building from blackprints) and will wait for the NPB to have been ninjad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Version 5.1.4.0 - .2\r\n\r\n####Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed Logicat countdown and clicker not working with Redacted object rewrited in 3.33331\r\n* Fixed option menu rewriten in same update\r\n* .1 : Fixed Logicat bug with audio alert\r\n* .2 : Fixed display problem with classic layout\r\n\r\n###Version 5.1.3\r\n\r\n####Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed Logicat solver to work with latest SCB changes.\r\n\r\n###Version 5.1.2\r\n\r\n####Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed Logicat solver to work with latest SCB changes.\r\n\r\n###Version 5.1.1\r\n\r\n####New Features\r\n* Re-implementing Pure Logicat Solver\r\n\r\n###Version 5.1\r\n\r\n####New Features\r\n* Logicats in a redundakitty chain are being solved.\r\n* Caged AutoClicker can solve single puzzles (1 per 5 seconds)\r\n* Caged AutoClicker can solve maximum puzzles (using this setting without having ZooKeeper may cause problems)\r\n* Caged AutoClicker can trade 100+ logicats for bonemeal (must have Shadow Dragon unlocked)\r\n\r\n###Version 5.0\r\n\r\n####New Features\r\n* Caged Logicat Autosolver implemented as Full Auto and re-enabled.\r\n\r\n####Temporary Bug Fixes/Workarounds\r\n* Logicats in a redundakitty chain are still set to auto-hide.\r\n\r\n###Version 4.9.9\r\n\r\n####Temporary Bug Fixes/Workarounds\r\n* Due to massive changes in v3.292 of Sandcastle builder, several features have been disabled in this build to allow it to function until a proper patch can be issued.\r\n* Caged Logicat AutoSolver has been Disabled\r\n* LC Solver will now Auto-Hide Logicats if they spawn.\r\n\r\n####Bug Fixes\r\n* LC audio alert fixed.\r\n\r\n###Version 4.2\r\n\r\n####Bug Fixes\r\n* With high logicat/AC, temporal rift is essentially permanent, preventing Keep Ninja AutoClick from processing.
